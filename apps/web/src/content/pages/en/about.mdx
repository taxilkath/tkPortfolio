<h2 id="summary">WHO AM I</h2>

I'm **Taxil Kathiriya**, a Full Stack Developer based in Manchester, United Kingdom, with over 4 years of experience building scalable, high-performance web applications across enterprise, retail, and logistics sectors.

I hold a **Master’s degree in Computer Science** from the University of Central Lancashire, with advanced coursework in web development, database systems, agile methodologies, and UI/UX design.

My technical expertise includes modern frameworks and technologies such as **React, Next.js, Node.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, AWS**, and **microservices architecture**. I've led solutions that enhanced POS systems, automated retail pricing rollouts, and optimized ERP platforms.

Currently, I’m contributing as a **Software Engineering Intern at A.F. Blakemore & Son**, where I’ve helped modernize legacy retail systems, integrate AWS cloud services, and improve inventory tracking through RFID and real-time dashboards.

In addition, I bring 2+ years of retail experience at Spar Manchester Airport and Co-op, which sharpened my customer-facing skills, operational awareness, and attention to detail—strengths that complement my technical development work by aligning it closely with real-world user needs.
