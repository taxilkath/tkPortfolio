- **Complex Calculations:** Implementing precise machining parameter formulas server-side to maintain accuracy.
- **Flexible Data Management:** Supporting CSV imports/exports and dynamic PDF report generation increased app complexity.
- **Security Improvements:** Incorporating helmet and bcrypt strengthened app resilience against common vulnerabilities.
- **Version Updates Needed:** Node.js version used is outdated (v14 EOL), highlighting the importance of staying current for security and performance.
